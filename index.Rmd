## How to use this presentation
<small>
The objective of this presentation is to go through some Lean core beliefs 
and pinpoint the differences between Lean in factory and development 
environments.

<br>

##### Navigate in these four ways:
1. If you go *horisonally* to the right you will see the slides in sequence.
2. If you go *down* on any step you will find a written instruction and,
3. if you hit *'esc'* you will see a navigational view of all the slides.
4. If you press *'s'* anywhere you come to the presenter's window.
