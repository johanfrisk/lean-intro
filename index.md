## How to use this presentation
<small>
The objective of this presentation is to go through some Lean core beliefs 
and pinpoint the differences between Lean in factory and development 
environments.

<br>

##### Navigate in these four ways:
1. If you go *horisonally* to the right you will see the slides in sequence.
2. If you go *down* on any step you will find a written instruction and,
3. if you hit *'esc'* you will see a navigational view of all the slides.
4. If you press *'s'* anywhere you come to the presenter's window.

##### Let's start from the beginning with project planning

## Traditional projekt planning
<small>
**spoiler: this is not the most efficient way of doing things!**
<br>
...we want control and accountability, but...

##### Discuss with your neighbour: How do you plan today?

##### Things are complicated...

***

### Common traps

1. <small>We think in lists and have a tendency to put actions one after another<br> which 
leads to longer than necessary projects.</small><br><br>
1. <small>We want control and forget that the more detailed the plan the more <br>fragile 
it gets.</small><br><br>
1. <small>We want to be forceful and bend the future to our will instead of <br>dealing 
with reality. We have the impossible dream that plans are time tables.</small>
<br><br>
<small>**A train driver cannot be allowed the same flexibility as a sheepdog.**</small><br>

### We assume to much...

1. <small>"We know how everything should be done, right from the start"</small><br>
1. <small>"The customer will not change their minds"</small><br>
1. <small>"The world will not change during the project"</small>
<br>
1. <small>"The salesman's dilemma does not exist"</small>
<br><br>
<small>**We act like the project is a canon ball and nothing will influence its flight.**</small><br>
<small>*But would we trust an airplane sent to New York without a pilot or navigation system?*</small><br>

## Management by means
<small>
**spoiler: this is better but not enough!**
<br>
...but, it is the bleeding edge in civil construction, forgotten since the '30s...

### Empire state building
- 500 trucks with material per day
- no storage space
- no flood lights - could only work days
- impossible to work during winter
- delivered on time in 18 months
<br><br>

### The secret...
- independent steel, walls, windows and floors
- detailed drawings as they were needed
- exra investments in fittings allowing flexibility
- daily replanning... using what they had on the day
- flexible workforce... they worked with <br>resource buffers and not time buffers
